# Data Structure and Algorithms with (C# and Python)

This repository contains an implementation of common Data Structures and Algorithms in (C#, and Python). I am taking the course Zero to Mastery: Master the Coding Interview - Data Structures + Algorithms course by Andrei Neagoie, implemented in Javascript. My aim is to understand the core concepts and implement them in C# and python.
